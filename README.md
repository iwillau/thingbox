Synchonisation of Tasks between Things and Teambox
=================================================

Teambox
-------

[Teambox][1] is a fantastic tool for small group collaboration. One of its (many) features is allowing you to create and delegate tasks.

Things
------
[Things][2] is my favourite task management tool. It allows you to create complete and organise your tasks very effectively, without enforcing a specific methodology. It also syncs to my mobile devices.

Goal
----
The goal of this little project was to enable task synchronisation between these two great products. Obviously, as Things is a Mac program, this script is designed to run on a mac.

Dependancies
------------
As this is written in Python, the dependancies can be installed via easy_install. 

 * simplejson (or json)
 * apsscript
